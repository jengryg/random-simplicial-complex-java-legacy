# Random Simplicial Complex Java Legacy Archived

This repository is a condensed version of multiple repositories I used during my time as a researcher.
It contains the code artifacts I wrote to create graphics for presentations and talks.

The code may not be able to run (anymore).

Note: The code is only here for archive purpose. 
It was only written to obtain the graphics it can generate.
